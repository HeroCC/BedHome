bedhome
=======

BedHome is a Bukkit plugin which allows you to teleport to your bed with a simple command: /bed

The plugin also has other (optional) features. You can choose to teleport to a bed that has been destroyed, or you can see it's co-ordinates. Or neither.

It saves player bed co-ordinates and worlds to *beds.yml*. As of me writing this, the 1.7.9 version is awaiting approval.
Players have one bed per world.

It also features an auto-updater. Of course, you can disable this in the config by setting "auto-update" to false.


Permissions
--------------

- **bedhome.bed** - this allows players to use the /bed command, if permissions are enabled in the config.

- **bedhome.config** - allows players to reload the config with /bedhome reload

- **bedhome.lookup** - allows players to lookup their bed (1.7.9 version)
